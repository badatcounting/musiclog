I am a guitar player who is trying to make some music using an Eleven Rack for recording guitar, bass and voice.
Most of the other instruments are synthesizers and other digital instruments, including the drums.

If you would like to use any of these attempts at music, please go ahead.
The license is pretty open.
We will of course appreciate an email to stroke our egos.

This site is used for all my music projects, see below:

Zero or One, I'm Bad at Counting
--------------------------------

This is my personal project, since 2011.

Few and Far Between
-------------------

This project includes me and a friend who writes the lyrics, sings the songs and plays the bass.
We have also had several other temporary members, since 2007.

Android killed the Litchi
-------------------------

My friend, who also plays guitar, and I meet up on a Saturday or Sunday and attempt to write, record and finish a song on the day.  We choose a genre or a band from the 1960s - 1990s, which has some guitar, and try to write a new song in that style. This typically takes about 5 hours.

Post Post
---------

Post Rock is our goal.  My guitar player friend and I try to write, record and complete a song in 4 to 5 hours.  Post Rock is an instrumental style of music, examples of bands include: God is an Astronaut and Maybe She Will.  Whenever you hear any shredding, that is not me playing the guitar, that is my friend muhaha!
