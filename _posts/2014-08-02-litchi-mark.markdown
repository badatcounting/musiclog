Here we are attempting something in the style of Brothers in arms by Mark Knopfler.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Android killed the Litchi - Imitations - 02 -  Tribute to Mark Knopfler.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

We have a 10 bar chord progression which is something like: C - C - A - F - C - C - A - F - F - F

I thought this chord progression might make it hard to realise that it is repeating and give a more continious feel to the song.
