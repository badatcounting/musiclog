This song has got my brain firing on all cylinders.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Post Post - Nostalgia - 03 - Pianos were made for Percussion.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

Do you remember when all the cool kids wanted to play piano?
