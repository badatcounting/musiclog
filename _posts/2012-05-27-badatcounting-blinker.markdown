I don't really think I can sing.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Experiments - 11 -  Blinker.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

I don't really think I can write lyrics either.

This is one of the few songs that I actually composed before I started recording it.
