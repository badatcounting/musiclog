This song was inspired by a T shirt: "999 Evil when I do handstands"

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Experiments - 09 -  Nine Nine Nine.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

The idea is that there are nine bars of music, of which the chord progression should repeat nine times.
Currently the song is still too short.
Maybe one day I'll finish it.
