Lyrics

Verse 1:

I can hear your call, it echoes through the halls
The slightest hint of sound, seeping through the walls
More than I can know, this message from below
Now silent was a voice, I heard but not by choice
It's clear to me now, there's some-one else around
I prove that I alive, by calling to you now
I've heard this before, an echo of whats no more
It's my own voice I hear, soon to disapear

Chorus 1:

You leave me dying here, as I'm bleeding on the floor
And I just have to ask, was it me you were looking for
I hear you crying from the dark, I try find what keeps us apart,
Your voice is starting to disapear, please take me away from here

Verse 2:

You left me hear, with the quite fear, that there's something left unknown
I could see the signs in your quite eyes, hoping for something more
As you walk away with a final tear, cause theres no words left to say
I'm left hear with one last beat, of what once was a broken heart

Chorus 2:

I hear you crying from the dark, I try find what keeps us apart,
Your voice is starting to disapear, please take me away from here
You leave me dying here, as I'm bleeding on the floor
And I just have to ask, was it me you were looking for
