In 2011 my friend came over and we wrote and recorded a new song in 24 hours.  This was when I realized that making a song in day is a great way to make music.  

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Totally Indie - Single - 01 -  Totally Indie.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

He taught me a lot in that day about how to use a digital audio workstation.  I just played some of the guitar and watched him work his magic.
