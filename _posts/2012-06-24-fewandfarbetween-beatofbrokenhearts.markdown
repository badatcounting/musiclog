The guitar is are not really in the style that the singer/song writer/bass player wanted.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Few and Far Between - EP - 04 -  Beat of Broken Hearts.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

I wanted to try something different.

Lyrics
------

I hear my thoughts calling out to yours again
let me in, let me see, what you dream

the silence marches on, to the beat of broken hearts
a quite smile hides, the truth of the thoughts you keep inside
eyes light up to hear, when words are said though incinscere
the silence marches on, and the silent walk alone

I never seem to know, of how much ive seen is what youve shown
sleepless nights weave truths, and dreams tell me what you wanted to
