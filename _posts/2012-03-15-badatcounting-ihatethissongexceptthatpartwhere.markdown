I was trying to make something against my natural instincts and tastes.
I ended up with something I did not like and was about to throw it away.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Experiments - 07 -  I hate things song except that part where.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

My girlfriend convinced me to keep it and to her credit, it grew on me.
