This is the first song I made using my Eleven Rack and Pro Tools 8 LE.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Experiments - 01 -  Ringtone for a Hero";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

The idea was that it should sound like intro music for an action series.
