I really enjoyed Ramfest 2011.
This is a Thank you to everyone who made it possible.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Experiments - 03 -  Thank You Ramfest 2011.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

I remember lying in my tent and not being able to go to sleep, because dubstep was playing until 7 am.  This was not a problem,  I actually rather enjoyed it.
