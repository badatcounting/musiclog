This song was playing just before my proposal to my wife.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Experiments - 13 -  In anticipation of proposal.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

I took two days off from work, so I could compose this song and the following song "In celebration of proposal" in secret.
