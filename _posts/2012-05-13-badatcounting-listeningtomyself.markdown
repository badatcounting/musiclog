Playing another note on the previously delayed note can have quite an interesting effect.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Experiments - 08 -  Listening to Myself.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

I think I should have made the delayed note a little louder.
