Interestingly a midi bass with distortion, playing very short notes, sounds a lot like an 8-bit instrument.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Post Post - Nostalgia - 05 - Multiplayer.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

This song makes us think of playing quake multiplayer.
