This is the first song I recorded for my girlfriend.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Zero or One I'm Bad at Counting - Experiments - 02 -  Stargazer (version 2).mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

This was one of her favourite songs, that I used to play over and over on the guitar.
