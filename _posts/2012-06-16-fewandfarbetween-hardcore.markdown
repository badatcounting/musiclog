We wrote this song in 2005 with some heavy Muse influences.
My then roommate wrote the drums.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var filename = "Few and Far Between - EP - 03 -  Hardcore.mp3";
  var path = "{{ "/music/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" + filename;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  document.write('<audio src="' + path + '" preload="auto"></audio>');
  document.write('<a href="' + path + '" download="' + filename + '">download</a>');
</script>

In 2012 we decided to record it just for fun.
The drums are still my old roommate's midi drums just with some reverb.
