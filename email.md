There are free services for this. I use blogtrottr.

  1. Simply go to <a href="https://blogtrottr.com/">https://blogtrottr.com/</a>
  2. Type in our rss link into the first text box: http://badatcounting.github.io/musiclog/feed.xml
  3. Next type in your email in the second text box and click the "Feed Me" button.
  4. Finaly you will receive and email to confirm that this is what you want to do. Simply click the confirmation link and you are done.

Now you will receive and email the next time we upload a song.
